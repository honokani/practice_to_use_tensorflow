# Readme of xor  

### Purpose  
   *  practice to use TensorFlow by solving xor classification  

### Point  
   *  learn the way to writing layer, weight, iterative learning and so on  
   *  especially, introduce bias term of NN by not adding `b` but increasing bias line.  

### Issue  
   *  `shape` function of TensorFlow cannot get the size of 2nd dim (until run, maybe)  
      because of this, this program cannot generalize function to create `w`  
      i ask you to advice for this
